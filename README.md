# Node.js CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js and connected to a database. It demonstrates the use of models and database integration to perform CRUD operations.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new entries to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display data from the database.
- **Update**: Edit existing entries in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove entries from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Mongoose/Sequelize/Other ORM (if used)**: For interacting with the database.

## API Endpoints

2. Use the provided routes to interact with the database.

## Future Improvements
